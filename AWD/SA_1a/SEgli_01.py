Semesterarbeit Teil 1a - Implementation

This file contains all Python functions implemented as part of the "Semesterarbeit Teil 1a"
    Available functions:
    fib(n)                  
        Calculate the Fibonacci sequence recursively 
    fib_formula(n)          
        Calculate the Fibonacci sequence by using a mathematical formula 
    fib_iterative(n)        
        Calculate the Fibonacci sequence using iteration
    fib_recursion_count(n)  
        Calculate the Nr. of function calls used when using fib(n)
    get_best_recursion_runtime(n)
        Measures the runtime taken when calling fib(n)
    get_best_iteration_runtime(n)
        Measures the runtime taken when calling fib_iterative(n)
    get_best_formula_runtime(n)
        Measures the runtime taken when calling fib_formula(n)

    Open work:
    1.  Reduce the amount of duplicated code for the measurement functions by passing the
        algorythm to use as an argument
    2.  Verify proper implementation with unit tests
